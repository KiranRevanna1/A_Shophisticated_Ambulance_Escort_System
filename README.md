# Project Name: A Sophisticated Escort System

## Environmental Setup

### Hardware Requirements
- Cameras for traffic monitoring (e.g., Condensed Microphone Camera 60FPS)
- Audio sensors or microphones for siren detection (e.g., Condensed Microphone)
- Arduino Mega board for signal control
- Ultraytics for data analysis
- Wire and jumper wires for hardware connections

### Software Requirements
- Python 3.7 or higher
- OpenCV library for computer vision (YOLO for object detection)
- Machine learning models for object detection (pre-trained YOLO model)
- Audio processing libraries for siren detection
- PyCharm or VS Code for development
- Arduino IDE for programming Arduino Mega board

## Software Details

### Ambulance Detection Algorithm
- Utilizes computer vision techniques and object detection algorithms (YOLO) to identify and track ambulances in real-time.
- Requires Python, OpenCV library, and pre-trained YOLO model.

### Siren Detection Algorithm
- Analyzes audio signals using signal processing techniques to detect ambulance sirens.
- Requires Python and audio processing libraries.

### Web Application
- Developed using React Native framework for intuitive user interface.
- Allows users to request ambulance services, track ambulances, and provides navigation to patients' location.
- Requires Node.js and React Native framework.
